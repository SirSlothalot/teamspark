        <p class="landing-paragraph">Sink your teeth into something bigger than a unit of school. Find the people
            who push your passions, need your talent and teach you more. Whether you want to develop your skills,
            beaf up your resume or try something new, sign up and find your team.

        <h1 class="big-title">For the clever</h1>

            <p class="landing-paragraph">Pitch your ideas, drive them with a team and have them come to life.
                Teamspark understands that it's difficult to find a team of likeminded people by word of mouth.
                If you need help with an idea, sign up, share it, and find your team. You have little to lose, and much to gain.

        <h1 class="big-title">Put it together</h1>

        <p class="landing-paragraph">Teamspark is a platform that creates teams and matches them with ideas.
            By analysing all the ideas people have posted and analysing the profile of each user, Teamspark's
            algorithms will form teams and assign those teams to ideas.

        <h2 class="medium-title">Step 1: Analysing an idea</h2>

        <p class="landing-paragraph">Teamspark considers the description of an idea, the skills required to complete that idea,
            the location of its creator and the time the creator is looking to commit.

        <h2 class="medium-title">Step 2: Find who matches an idea</h2>

        <p class="landing-paragraph">Teamspark identifies people best suited to an idea by comparing an idea's details with user profiles.

        <h2 class="medium-title">Step 3: Form teams from the matched people</h2>

        <p class="landing-paragraph">Teamspark forms teams by finding people in a similar location, with similar interests, of similar age
            and who, as a team, have the skills required to work on an idea.
